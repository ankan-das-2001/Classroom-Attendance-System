Tensorflow based face recognized attendance system
---
<br>

__*Authentication*__ is one of the significant issues in the era of information system. Among other things, human face recognition (HFR) is one of known techniques which can be used for user authentication.

We have used face detection along with with face recognition technique to build this attendance recognition system. The system  will  record the  attendance  of  the  students in class room environment automatically and it will provide the facilities  to  the  faculty  to access  the  information  of  the students  easily  by maintaining a log for clock-in and clock-out time.
