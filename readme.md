# Classroom Attendance System

__*Authentication*__ is one of the significant issues in the era of information system. Among other things, human face recognition (HFR) is one of known techniques which can be used for user authentication.

We have used face detection along with with face recognition technique to build this attendance recognition system. The  system  will  record the  attendance  of  the  students  in  class  room  environment automatically  and  it  will  provide  the  facilities  to  the  faculty  to access  the  information  of  the  students  easily  by maintaining  a log for clock-in and clock-out time.

## Project Status
